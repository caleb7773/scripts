Sitting in Day 1 Installing Linux


Edit /etc/crypttab.

sudo vim /etc/crypttab

Add a line under the dm_crypt-0 line, then save the file.

dm_crypt-0 UUID=12345678-90ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde none luks
crypt_swap /swap.img /dev/urandom swap

Edit /etc/fstab.

sudo vim /etc/fstab

Comment out the line beginning with /swap.img and add /dev/mapper/crypt_swap none swap sw 0 0 below it.

#/swap.img         none    swap    sw       0       0
/dev/mapper/crypt_swap none swap sw 0 0

Reboot. Enter the passphrase when required and login.

Confirm the encrypted swap is working.  The lsblk command should show a loopX device with crypt_swap attached to it under NAME and the MOUNTPOINT column should have [SWAP] next to crypt_swap.



Checking it another way:
ls /dev/mapper

You should now see "ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv" file

swapon -s

should see "/dev/dm-2"
If you see "/dev/swap" you've done it wrong
